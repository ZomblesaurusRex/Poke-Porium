### Giphy API
## Poke'Porium - Basic Assignment User Story

* I created an Poke'Porium Fun App full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
* Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI
	* I made an array of actions and made buttons out of them.
* When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
* When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
* You can add a new action from the form in the center of the page. The actions will be added to the array of giphs and added as a new button
